# sdl-ts

[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) bindings for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Currently working via [deno](https://deno.land/) on Windows using [FFI](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/ffi_api)
(Foreign Function Interface).

## Goals

- Resembling the C API as much as possible. If someone reads a SDL tutorial (for example
  [LazyFoo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)) then they should be able to easily translate the tutorial to the
  equivalent in this library.

## Non Goals

- Creating a higher level API or Game Framework. This library's only purpose is to expose the SDL API to deno.
